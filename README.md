DoveMQ
======

DoveMQ is an [AMQP 1.0](http://www.amqp.org) based messaging framework, written in Java.
It has a standalone AMQP Broker and an API to write messaging applications.


DoveMQ API supports the following capability to interact with a Broker:

* Point-to-point message queuing.
* Publish-Subscribe using Topics.
* Topic-hierarchy based message routing.
* Tag-filter based message routing.

In addition to the above, DoveMQ provides API to run as a peer to peer AMQP transport, without a Broker.
