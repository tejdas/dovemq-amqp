      <p>
        The term message is used with various connotations in the messaging world. The sender may
        like to think of the message as an immutable payload handed off to the messaging
        infrastructure for delivery. The receiver often thinks of the message as not only that
        immutable payload from the sender, but also various annotations supplied by the messaging
        infrastructure along the way. To avoid confusion we formally define the term <i>bare
        message</i> to mean the message as supplied by the sender and the term <i>annotated
        message</i> to mean the message as seen at the receiver.
      </p>

      <p>
        An <i>annotated message</i> consists of the bare message plus sections for annotation at the
        head of the bare message. There are two classes of annotations: annotations that
        travel with the message indefinitely, and annotations that are consumed by the next node.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <i>bare message</i> consists of sections standard properties, application-properties,
        and application-data (the body).
      </p>

      <p>
        The bare message is immutable within the AMQP network. That is none of the sections can be
        changed by any node acting as an AMQP intermediary. If a section of the bare message is
        omitted, one may not be inserted by an intermediary. The exact encoding of sections of the
        bare message MUST NOT be modified. This preserves message hashes, HMACs and signatures based
        on the binary encoding of the bare message.
      </p>

      <p>
        The exact structure of a message, together with its encoding, is defined by the
        <xref name="MESSAGE-FORMAT"/>. This document defines the structure and semantics of message
        format <i>0</i>. Altogether a message consists of the following sections:
      </p>

          <p>
            This field contains the relative Message priority. Higher numbers indicate higher
            priority Messages. Messages with higher priorities MAY be delivered before those with
            lower priorities.
          </p>

          <p>
            An AMQP intermediary implementing distinct priority levels MUST do so in the following
            manner:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                If n distinct priorities are implemented and n is less than 10 -- priorities 0 to
                (5 - ceiling(n/2)) MUST be treated equivalently and MUST be the lowest effective
                priority.  The priorities (4 + floor(n/2)) and above MUST be treated equivalently
                and MUST be the highest effective priority. The priorities (5 - ceiling(n/2)) to (4
                + floor(n/2)) inclusive MUST be treated as distinct priorities.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                If n distinct priorities are implemented and n is 10 or greater -- priorities 0 to
                (n - 1) MUST be distinct, and priorities n and above MUST be equivalent to priority
                (n - 1).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Thus, for example, if 2 distinct priorities are implemented, then levels 0 to 4 are
            equivalent, and levels 5 to 9 are equivalent and levels 4 and 5 are distinct. If 3
            distinct priorities are implements the 0 to 3 are equivalent, 5 to 9 are equivalent and
            3, 4 and 5 are distinct.
          </p>

          <p>
            This scheme ensures that if two priorities are distinct for a server which implements m
            separate priority levels they are also distinct for a server which implements n
            different priority levels where n &gt; m.

            set then a message expiration time will be computed based on the time of arrival at an
            intermediary. Messages that live longer than their expiration time will be discarded
            (or dead lettered). When a message is transmitted by an intermediary that was received
            with a ttl, the transmitted message's header should contain a ttl that is computed as
            the difference between the current time and the formerly computed message expiration
            time, ie the reduced ttl, so that messages will eventually die if they end up in a
            delivery loop.

          The delivery-annotations section is used for delivery-specific non-standard properties at
          the head of the message. Delivery annotations convey information from the sending peer to
          the receiving peer. If the recipient does not understand the annotation it cannot be acted
          upon and its effects (such as any implied propagation) cannot be acted upon. Annotations
          may be specific to one implementation, or common to multiple implementations. The
          capabilities negotiated on link <xref name="attach"/> and on the <xref name="source"/> and
          <xref name="target"/> should be used to establish which annotations a peer supports. A

          The message-annotations section is used for properties of the message which are aimed at
          the infrastructure and should be propagated across every delivery step. Message
          annotations convey information about the message. Intermediaries MUST propagate the
          annotations unless the annotations are explicitly augmented or modified (e.g. by the use

          intermediary will understand the annotation. Note that for some annotation it may not be
          necessary for the intermediary to understand their purpose - they may be being used purely

            As per RFC-2046 this may contain a charset parameter defining

            When using an application-data section with a section code other than <i>data</i>,
            a client MAY omit the content-type, but, if it does not, it should specify an

          <p>
            The Content-Encoding property is used as a modifier to the content-type.
            When present, its value indicates what additional content encodings have been applied
            to the application-data, and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied in order to
            obtain the media-type referenced by the content-type header field.

          <p>
            Content-Encoding is primarily used to allow a document to be compressed without

            Content Encodings are to be interpreted as per Section 3.5 of RFC 2616. Valid Content

          <p>
            Implementations MUST NOT use the <i>identity</i> encoding. Instead, implementations
            should not set this property. Implementations SHOULD NOT
            use the <i>compress</i> encoding, except as to remain compatible with messages

    <doc>
      <p>
        The Messaging layer defines a concrete set of delivery states which can be used (via the
        <xref type="type" name="disposition"/> frame) to indicate the state of the message at the
        receiver. Delivery states may be either terminal or non-terminal. Once a delivery reaches a
        terminal delivery-state, the state for that delivery will no longer change. A terminal
        delivery-state is referred to as an <i>outcome</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following outcomes are formally defined by the messaging layer to indicate the result of
        processing at the receiver:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><xref name="accepted"/>: indicates successful processing at the receiver</p>

      <p>
        The following non-terminal delivery-state is formally defined by the messaging layer for use

  <section name="message-state" title="Distribution Nodes"
           label="common interface for nodes that store and distribute messages">

    <doc title="Message States">
      <p>
        The Messaging layer defines a set of states for Messages stored at a <i>distribution
        node</i>. Not all Nodes store Messages for distribution, however these definitions permit
        some standardized interaction with those nodes that do. The transitions between these states
        are controlled by the transfer of Messages to/from a distribution node and the resulting
        terminal delivery state. Note that the state of a Message at one distribution node does not
        affect the state of the same Message at a separate node.
      </p>

      <p>
        By default a Message will begin in the AVAILABLE state. Prior to initiating an
        <i>acquiring</i> transfer, the Message will transition to the ACQUIRED state. Once in the
        ACQUIRED state, a Messages is ineligible for <i>acquiring</i> transfers to any other Links.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Message will remain ACQUIRED at the distribution node until the transfer is settled. The
        delivery state at the receiver determines how the message transitions when the transfer is
        settled. If the delivery state at the receiver is not yet known, (e.g. the link endpoint is
        destroyed before recovery occurs) the <i>default-outcome</i> of the source is used.
      </p>

      <p>
        State transitions may also occur spontaneously at the distribution node. For example if a
        Message with a ttl expires, the effect of expiry may be (depending on specific type and
        configuration of the distribution node) to move spontaneously from the AVAILABLE state into
        the ARCHIVED state. In this case any transfers of the message are settled by the
        distribution node regardless of receiver state.

        The messaging layer defines two concrete types (<xref type="type" name="source"/> and
        <xref type="type" name="target"/>) to be used as the <i>source</i> and <i>target</i> of a
        link. These types are supplied in the <i>source</i> and <i>target</i> fields of the
        <xref type="type" name="attach"/> frame when establishing or resuming link. The
        <xref type="type" name="source"/> is comprised of an address (which the container of the
        outgoing Link Endpoint will resolve to a Node within that container) coupled with properties
        which determine:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            which messages from the sending Node will be sent on the Link,

          <p>

            the behaviour of Messages which have been transferred on the Link, but have not yet

    <doc title="Filtering Messages">
      <p>
        A source can restrict the messages transferred from a source by specifying a <i>filter</i>.
        Filters can be thought of as functions which take the message as input and return a boolean
        value: true if the message will be accepted by the source, false otherwise. A <i>filter</i>
        MUST NOT change its return value for a Message unless the state or annotations on the
        Message at the Node change (e.g. through an updated delivery state).
      </p>
    </doc>

    <doc title="Distribution Modes">
      <p>
        The Source defines an optional distribution-mode that informs and/or indicates how
        distribution nodes are to behave with respect to the Link. The distribution-mode of a Source
        determines how Messages from a distribution node are distributed among its associated Links.
        There are two defined distribution-modes: <i>move</i> and <i>copy</i>. When specified, the
        distribution-mode has two related effects on the behaviour of a distribution node with
        respect to the Link associated with the Source.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <i>move</i> distribution-mode causes messages transferred from the distribution node to
        transition to the ACQUIRED state prior to transfer over the link, and subsequently to the
        ARCHIVED state when the transfer is settled with a successful outcome. The <i>copy</i>
        distribution-mode leaves the state of the Message unchanged at the distribution node.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Source MUST NOT resend a Message which has previously been successfully transferred from
        the Source, i.e. reached an ACCEPTED delivery state at the receiver. For a
        <i>move</i> link with a default configuration this is trivially achieved as such an end
        result will lead to the Message in the ARCHIVED state on the Node, and thus anyway
        ineligible for transfer. For a <i>copy</i> link, state must be retained at the source to
        ensure compliance. In practice, for nodes which maintain a strict order on Messages at the
        node, the state may simply be a record of the most recent Message transferred.
